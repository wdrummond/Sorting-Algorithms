# Sorting-Algorithms

Demonstration of my knowledge of different algorithms.
The Main.py file will run each of the different sorting algorthims against a list of 2048 integers. It will then sort a copy of the same list iwth Pythons built in sorting algorithm and check to see if the two are the same.
Tested Algorithms:
- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Hash sort
- Quick sort AND a modified Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Shaker sort
